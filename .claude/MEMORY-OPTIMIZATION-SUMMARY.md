## System Architecture

### Memory Flow
1. **Assessment**: Check available memory and calculate spawn capacity
2. **Batching**: Dynamically size batches based on memory constraints
3. **Spawning**: Launch agents with memory-optimized configuration
4. **Monitoring**: Track memory usage throughout execution
5. **Cleanup**: Verify resource cleanup after completion
6. **Learning**: Record patterns for future optimization

### Configuration Hierarchy
- **System Level**: 96GB total memory, 8-12 agent maximum
- **Coordinator**: 16GB heap allocation with GC optimization
- **Agents**: 8GB heap each (reduced to 4GB for retries)
- **Batching**: Dynamic sizing from 1-8 agents per batch

## Performance Characteristics

### Before Optimization
- Unlimited parallel spawning
- Linear memory growth with concurrent streams
- Potential heap limit errors on large workloads
- No resource monitoring or cleanup verification

### After Optimization
- **Memory-Aware Spawning**: Maximum 8 concurrent agents (64GB + 16GB coordinator)
- **Dynamic Batching**: Automatic workload distribution based on available memory
- **Retry Logic**: Memory-optimized retry with 50% heap reduction
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time memory tracking and cleanup verification
- **Learning System**: Historical pattern analysis for continuous optimization

## Usage Examples

### Start Memory-Optimized Coordinator
```bash
source .claude/scripts/pm/start-coordinator.sh
```

### Check System Memory Capacity
```bash
.claude/scripts/pm/memory-monitor.sh check
```

### Monitor Memory Usage During Execution
```bash
.claude/scripts/pm/coordination-memory.sh epic-name monitor
```

### Analyze Memory Patterns and Get Recommendations
```bash
.claude/scripts/pm/memory-feedback.sh recommend
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Parallel-Worker Agent Changes
- Memory assessment phase added before spawning
- Batch execution with memory monitoring
- Enhanced error reporting with memory metrics
- Cleanup verification in consolidation phase

### Configuration Changes
- Added memory management section to `.claude-pm.yaml`
- Environment files for coordinator and agent processes
- NODE_OPTIONS optimization for V8 heap management

### Command Integration
- All existing PM commands work unchanged
- Enhanced with memory monitoring and optimization
- Automatic fallback to single-agent mode if memory constrained

## Benefits Achieved

### Memory Stability
- **Prevents OOM**: Heap limit errors eliminated through capacity assessment
- **Predictable Usage**: Maximum 64GB + 16GB = 80GB of 96GB system memory
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verified cleanup after each agent completion

### Performance Optimization
- **Optimal Batching**: Dynamic batch sizes for maximum throughput
- **Efficient Retry**: Memory-optimized retry logic for failed streams
- **Learning System**: Continuous optimization based on usage patterns

### System Reliability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to smaller batches when memory constrained
