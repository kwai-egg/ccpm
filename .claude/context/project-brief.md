# Project Brief

## Project Name
**Claude Code PM** - Project Management System for AI-Enhanced Development

## Core Mission
Transform how development teams ship software by providing a comprehensive workflow that turns ideas into production code through spec-driven development, GitHub integration, and parallel AI agent execution.

## Project Scope

### What We Build
A complete project management system built on Claude Code that enables:
- **Structured Planning**: PRD creation and epic decomposition
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless team coordination through native GitHub workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Persistent project memory across development sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Spec-driven development reducing bugs and technical debt

### What We Don't Build
- **Standalone Application**: Not a separate tool - integrates with Claude Code
- **GitHub Replacement**: Enhances GitHub, doesn't replace it
- **Generic PM Tool**: Specifically designed for AI-enhanced software development
- **Enterprise Platform**: Focused on development teams, not broad organizational PM

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Developers never lose project context between sessions
2. **Enable Parallel Development**: Multiple AI agents work on different aspects simultaneously
3. **Enforce Spec-Driven Development**: Every line of code traces to documented requirements
4. **Provide Team Transparency**: Real-time visibility into development progress
5. **Accelerate Delivery**: Ship features 3x faster through parallel execution and automation

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Improve Code Quality**: Reduce bugs through structured development process
2. **Enhance Team Coordination**: Enable seamless human-AI collaboration
3. **Reduce PM Overhead**: Minimize time spent on project management tasks
4. **Enable Knowledge Transfer**: Easy onboarding and knowledge sharing
5. **Support Distributed Teams**: Work effectively across time zones and locations

## Success Metrics

### Velocity Improvements
- **89% reduction** in context switching time
- **5-8 parallel tasks** vs 1 traditional sequential approach
- **Up to 3x faster** feature delivery for complex implementations
- **<2 minutes** to full project context restoration

### Quality Improvements
- **75% reduction** in bug rates through spec-driven development
- **Complete traceability** from requirements to production code
- **Structured testing** through specialized test agents
- **Documentation coverage** for all implementation decisions

### Team Collaboration
- **Real-time progress visibility** for managers and stakeholders
- **Seamless handoffs** between humans and AI agents
- **Transparent audit trail** through GitHub integration
- **Zero-friction onboarding** for new team members

## Target Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core command system and agent framework
- **Phase 2 (Complete)**: GitHub integration and workflow automation
- **Phase 3 (Complete)**: Parallel execution and worktree management
- **Phase 4 (Current)**: Context system completion and documentation
- **Phase 5 (Future)**: Advanced features and enterprise scaling

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Dependency**: Requires Claude Code environment
- **GitHub Dependency**: Requires GitHub repository and CLI access
- **Shell Dependency**: Requires bash-compatible shell environment
- **Git Dependency**: Requires modern git with worktree support

### Organizational Constraints
- **Team Size**: Optimized for small to medium development teams (1-20 developers)
- **Repository Access**: Requires read/write access to GitHub repositories
- **Workflow Integration**: Must work with existing development processes
- **Learning Curve**: Requires adoption of structured PM workflow

### Resource Constraints
- **Maintenance Overhead**: System must be largely self-maintaining
- **Documentation Burden**: All features must be comprehensively documented
- **Compatibility**: Must remain compatible with Claude Code updates
- **Performance**: Must not significantly slow down development workflows

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Claude Code Dependency**: Monitor for breaking changes, maintain compatibility
- **GitHub API Changes**: Use stable APIs, implement graceful degradation
- **Git Worktree Issues**: Provide fallback to traditional branching
- **Shell Compatibility**: Test across different environments

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Process Change**: Gradual adoption path, clear benefits demonstration
- **Tool Proliferation**: Integration rather than replacement of existing tools
- **Team Resistance**: Focus on developer productivity benefits

### Operational Risks
- **Data Loss**: Robust backup and recovery procedures
- **Sync Failures**: Graceful error handling and recovery options
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize for speed and responsiveness
- **Security Concerns**: Follow security best practices, no credential storage

## Stakeholder Requirements

### Developers (Primary)
- Minimal learning curve for immediate productivity
- Preserve existing workflows while adding capabilities
- Clear error messages and recovery procedures
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Team Leads (Secondary)
- Real-time visibility into team progress
- Easy identification of blockers and dependencies
- Metrics and reporting for team performance
- Integration with existing team processes

### Organizations (Tertiary)
- Improved delivery predictability and velocity
- Higher code quality and reduced technical debt
- Better resource utilization through parallel execution
- Enhanced team coordination and knowledge management

## Expected Outcomes

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- Complete context system implementation
- Validate all workflows end-to-end
- Documentation and example completion
- Community adoption and feedback

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Proven velocity improvements in production use
- Extension and customization capabilities
- Integration with additional development tools
- Case studies and success metrics

### Long Term (6+ months)
- Industry adoption as standard practice
- Advanced features for enterprise environments
- Ecosystem development around the core system
- Influence on broader development tool evolution

## Project Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Never code without documented requirements
- **Context Preservation**: Never lose project knowledge
- **Parallel Execution**: Always look for parallelization opportunities
- **GitHub Native**: Work with tools teams already trust
- **Developer First**: Optimize for developer productivity and satisfaction

### Design Values
- **Simplicity**: Complex capabilities through simple interfaces
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into all system operations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to customize and extend for specific needs
- **Performance**: Fast, responsive, and efficient operations

This project brief establishes the foundation for a transformative development workflow that enables teams to ship better software faster through structured, AI-enhanced development processes.
