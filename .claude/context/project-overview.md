# Project Overview

## What is Claude Code PM?

Claude Code PM is a comprehensive project management system that transforms how development teams ship software. It provides a battle-tested workflow that turns PRDs into epics, epics into GitHub issues, and issues into production code – with full traceability at every step.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
**Complete Requirement Traceability**
- **PRD Creation**: Guided brainstorming creates comprehensive Product Requirements Documents
- **Epic Planning**: PRDs transform into technical implementation plans with architectural decisions
- **Task Decomposition**: Epics break down into concrete, actionable tasks with acceptance criteria
- **GitHub Sync**: All work synchronizes to GitHub issues for team coordination
- **Code Implementation**: Every line of code traces back to documented specifications

### 2. Memory-Optimized Parallel AI Agent Execution (Enhanced)
**Memory-Aware Multi-Stream Development**
- **Agent Specialization**: Different agents handle code analysis, file processing, testing, and parallel execution
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic batching with 8-12 concurrent agents based on system capacity
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time memory tracking and cleanup verification
- **Context Optimization**: Agents work in isolation to prevent context pollution in main conversation
- **Worktree Isolation**: Each epic works in its own git worktree to prevent conflicts
- **Coordinated Completion**: Multiple agents complete different aspects of the same feature simultaneously
- **Clean Integration**: All parallel work merges cleanly when complete

### 3. GitHub-Native Team Coordination
**True Human-AI Collaboration**
- **Issue Management**: Automated creation and management of GitHub issues
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time updates visible to entire team through issue comments
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Proper epic-task relationships through gh-sub-issue extension
- **Audit Trail**: Complete development history preserved in GitHub
- **Team Handoffs**: Seamless transitions between humans and AI agents

### 4. Persistent Context Management
**Never Lose Project Memory**
- **Session Continuity**: Full project context restored in under 2 minutes
- **Knowledge Preservation**: All architectural decisions and implementation details documented
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Context grows richer with each development session
- **Team Onboarding**: New team members get complete project understanding immediately
- **Cross-Session Coordination**: Work continues seamlessly across multiple development sessions
