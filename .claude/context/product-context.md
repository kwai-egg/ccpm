# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary Users: Software Development Teams
- **Individual Developers**: Working with Claude Code on solo projects
- **Small Teams (2-5 developers)**: Need coordination without overhead
- **AI-Enhanced Teams**: Teams leveraging AI agents for development acceleration
- **Startups**: Fast-moving teams needing spec-driven development

### Secondary Users: Technical Leaders
- **Engineering Managers**: Need visibility into development progress
- **Technical Product Managers**: Require traceability from requirements to code
- **Architects**: Need documentation of technical decisions
- **QA Engineers**: Require structured test planning and execution

## User Pain Points Addressed

### 1. Context Evaporation
**Problem**: Development teams lose project context between sessions
**Solution**: Persistent context system with comprehensive project documentation
**Impact**: 89% reduction in context switching time

### 2. Serial Development Bottlenecks
**Problem**: Traditional development forces sequential task execution
**Solution**: Parallel agent execution with worktree isolation
**Impact**: 5-8 parallel tasks vs 1 previously, 3x faster feature delivery

### 3. "Vibe Coding" Without Specifications
**Problem**: Development proceeds from memory without documented requirements
**Solution**: Spec-driven development from PRD → Epic → Tasks → Code
**Impact**: 75% reduction in bug rates through detailed task breakdown

### 4. Invisible Progress
**Problem**: Development progress hidden until completion
**Solution**: GitHub integration with transparent audit trail
**Impact**: Real-time visibility for managers and team members

### 5. Manual Project Coordination
**Problem**: Teams spend significant time on project management overhead
**Solution**: Intelligent prioritization and automated task coordination
**Impact**: Focus on building, not managing

## Core Value Propositions

### For Individual Developers
- **Never lose context again** - persistent project memory across sessions
- **Ship faster** - parallel execution with multiple AI agents
- **Higher code quality** - spec-driven development reduces bugs
- **Less project management overhead** - automated coordination

### For Development Teams
- **True collaboration** - GitHub-native workflow enables team coordination
- **Seamless human-AI handoffs** - team members can jump in anywhere
- **Transparent progress** - managers see real-time development status
- **Scalable beyond solo work** - supports distributed teams

### For Technical Leaders
- **Complete traceability** - every line of code traces to specifications
- **Predictable delivery** - structured approach reduces uncertainty
- **Team productivity insights** - clear progress metrics and velocity
- **Quality assurance** - built-in testing and validation workflows

## User Stories

### Epic Planning User Story
```
As a developer starting a new feature,
I want to transform my rough idea into a comprehensive implementation plan,
So that I can build exactly what's needed without missing requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create comprehensive PRD through guided brainstorming
- Generate technical epic with architectural decisions
- Break epic into concrete, actionable tasks
- Push to GitHub for team visibility
```

### Parallel Development User Story
```
As a development team,
I want multiple AI agents working on different parts of the same feature,
So that we can deliver features faster without conflicts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Spawn multiple agents for different work streams
- Isolate work in separate worktrees to prevent conflicts
- Coordinate agent completion for clean merges
- Maintain progress visibility across all work streams
```

### Context Preservation User Story
```
As a developer returning to a project after days/weeks,
I want to immediately understand the current state and next steps,
So that I can continue productive work without rediscovering context.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Load complete project context in seconds
- Understand recent progress and current priorities
- Access full implementation history and decisions
- Continue work seamlessly where it left off
```

### Team Coordination User Story
```
As an engineering manager,
I want to see real-time development progress across my team,
So that I can provide support and remove blockers proactively.

Acceptance Criteria:
- View all active epics and their completion status
- See which team members are working on which tasks
- Understand blockers and dependencies
- Get standup reports automatically
```
